difficulty and select 2 for hard difficulty. The first player will be randomly chosen as well as the size of the 
marble pile. You will receive a prompt letting you know which player will play first. In the case that computer 
plays first, it will remove marbles from the pile in accordance with the rules of Nim. The rules are that you 
must take out at least one marble and at most half the pile remaining. The player to take out the last marble 
loses the game.
